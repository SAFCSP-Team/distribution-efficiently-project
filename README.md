## Distribution Efficiently Project

### Objective
The purpose of this project is to learn how to distribute an array and practice calculating the time and space complexity.

### Problem
You're required to break the array into two dimensional array, then calculate the time and space complexity.
Exampel:

```
["one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight"]
```


### Implementation
- Create a function that takes an ArrayList as an argument.

### Qualification to pass
- [ ] The code should run successfully.
- [ ] Write all the required functions correctly.
